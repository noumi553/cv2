# 🧠 CV2 Computer Vision Projects

This repository contains a collection of **Python + OpenCV** projects focused on real-time detection and tracking — including faces, eyes, smiles, cars, people, and hands.

Each script demonstrates practical use of computer vision techniques for beginners and intermediate developers learning **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and related AI libraries.

| Project | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| 👁️ **Face & Smile Detection** | Detects faces, eyes, and smiles using Haar Cascade classifiers. |
| 🚗 **Car Detection** | Detects cars in video footage using `cars.xml` cascade. |
| 🚶 **Person Detection** | Detects full bodies in video using the `haarcascade_fullbody.xml` model. |
| ✋ **Hand Tracking (MediaPipe)** | Tracks 21 hand
